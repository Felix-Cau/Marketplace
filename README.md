# Marketplace

This is a small marketplace app in WinForms that I created as part of a school assignment. It's designed as part of my training in SQL and ADO.NET.

In this app, you can search and inspect different advertisements. If you log in, you can also post, edit, and remove your own advertisements. While logged in, you also have access to a simple messaging service to contact other sellers within the app.
